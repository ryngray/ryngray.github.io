The MCM or Mathematical Competition in Modeling is a competition that I completed during my undergraduate at CU Boulder.

In 2019, my team and I received a Meritorious finish, which is the top 6% of teams.  I did this work with Ksenia Lepikhina and Rachel Moore (the document is what we submitted, which did not include names).

In 2018, my team and I received an Honorable Mention, given to the top 33% of teams.  This work was done with Cori Hudson and Maxine Hartnett.
