# Dancing - Lindy Hop

## The Jelly Roles

The jelly roles are a group of dancers dedicated to promoting switch and gender neutral dancing.  We firmly believe that switch dancing is a valid dance and should not be looked down on by any organization, competition, or human.  We believe that men can follow, women can lead, and anyone on the gender spectrum can dance how they like.  We believe that masculine follows and feminine leads are not less than the status quo.  We work to give people a safe place to dance no matter their role.

## Current Projects

The Jelly Roles are running the Switch-a-room at Camp Hollywood.  We will have a showcase (the Switch-a-roo) 7pm - 8pm where people will be able to show off their switch dancing and then open role dancing from 8pm - 1am.

Ryn currently is president of the [Arizona Swing Cats](arizonaswingcats.com).  Arizona Swing Cats have lessons every Wednesday as well as social dances the 2nd Saturday and 3rd Sunday of every month.  Find them on Facebook and Instagram at AZSwingCats.

## Dance Geneology Project

I managed a small dance geneology project at the Tuscon Lindy Exchange 2021.  I will update below with the results and eventually may add some ways for folks to continue adding to the project.
