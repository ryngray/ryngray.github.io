# Parkside Switch Camp

This is at least one installment that I will have in this.  I have only started writing and I also probably won't edit much, so apologies for any weird grammar.

# The Event

The event took place in Melbourne, Australia on October 24-26.  First of all, this was in a location right next to the Melbourne Zoo.  This meant, for the first day (which was only check-in), we could go to the Zoo and then start hanging out.  

The event had lessons on Saturday and Sunday and a social dance on Saturday. For more information, I suggest looking at their website: [Parkside Switch Camp](https://parksidecamp.wixsite.com/2023).  Especially if you're looking for teachers, the instructors at the camp were awesome and I highly recommend!

# Day 1, Friday

Friday was open to those that wanted to stay that evening, which we did, since it coincided nicely with the days we had for our previous hotel.  Many of the people who stayed this evening were from all over Australia (and the world).  There was even another international switch dancer, going to a different conference.  This day consisted of lots of chats about how switch dancing is in the various communities.  Many commonalities arose.  

## Gender Perception

Turns out this is a problem everywhere.  Many men or masculine presenting people have difficulties following more than women leading.  This has a variety of reasons, most often, the feedback is that the male leads do not want to dance with male follows because they're not gay.  This is adding sexuality onto dancing which is not sexual.  On the flip side, since women loving women has often been fetishized or seen as "not real", women have a much easier time leading.  Additionally, dancing in general is often seen as feminine and it can be assumed that women only lead because they have to.  

At the switch workshop, this did actually mirror many women and femme presenting people's stories.  They started leading because they wanted to dance more in a follow-heavy environment.  Many of these people at the switch workshop found that they actually liked leading and the freedom it gave them.

## Accepting Switch Dancing

There were many talks about various scenes and how accepting they were of switch dancing.  In a future post, I will go over some of the discussions specifically on that.  There seemeed to be a few varieties of scenes that had switch dancing.

### Small Scene, Small Switch  

The first included a scene that was very gendered and had only a few switch dancers.  The dancers who came from that scene were really excited to share switch dancing and it seemed like were bolstered by the weekend.  I hope that they were able to make connections for support as they go and begin switching more regularly at their scene.  Often, these scenes were described as skewing older.  I want to be careful with this, since in my experience, we as dancers often make assumptions about people's ideas based on their age.  We have people in our scene that are very accepting of all genders doing all roles and some that are less so.  I think this has more to do with how long the scene has been around and how open they are as a scene to change.  I have hope for these scenes as I believe that switch dancers can be great leaders in their scenes and I saw many such leaders at this weekend.

### Small Scene, Large Switch

The second variety of scene that I heard about was a small scene that had a very strong switch group.  This is the category that I would put my own switch scene under.  These scenes were strongly represented at this switch workshop weekend.  Very often, people from these scenes would seem apologetic that they couldn't provide feedback for other kinds of scenes.  Personally, I was excited to see other scenes like mine flourishing.  I think that small switch scenes can raise strong dancers, especially dancers who are able to be leaders in their scene.  This was also the kind of scene that had many ideas coming out of them around switch dancing.  I was really encouraged to see other scenes have strong switch contingents, even if they were small in number.

### Large Scene, Small Switch

This is sometimes hard to distinguish from the previous one, since connections among switch dancers are often strong, and sub-groups will form around it.  However, these are the type of scenes that could support ELEF progressive classes.  I really enjoyed listening to how people in these scenes were carving out a niche for themselves even among the larger scene around them.  This is also where I would put Camp Hollywood, the event is so large and there is a large amount of switching for what it is.  However, this year was the first year that there were classes focused on breaking down roles and created a specific room for people who wanted to practice switch or other roles.  The number of people who switch at Camp Hollywood is small compared to its total size.

### Large Scene, Large Switch

If only.  I don't think anyone came from a scene that was majority switch dancers and could call themselves large.  This is probably my ideal scene, but it is probably a few years away yet.  I think the people in a large scene who are pushing switch dancing are in a position to go towards this ideal, and many of them were.
