#Switch dancing

Switch dancing (for me) incompases everything that is not traditional leading and following.  Often, this involves switching who is leading and who is following in a dance.  But I believe this can also include things such as no one leading/following, power following, and more.  

I currently teach switch dancing concepts in Tucson, Arizona.  Please reach out if you are curious on what this looks like for a tiny scene.

I judged the Open Role Contest at Camp Hollywood in 2023.  I also helped organize and run the Switch-A-Roo and the Switch-A-Room at Camp Hollywood in 2023.  Follow [@the\_jelly\_roles](https://www.instagram.com/the_jelly_roles/) on Instagram for video of this.
