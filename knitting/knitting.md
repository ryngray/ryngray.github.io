# Knitting

I have been knitting since I was about 8.  I learned some basics from my mom and then systematically went through all the knitting books that were at my library.  I got lucky and had a lovely yarn shop near me ([Longmont Yarn Shoppe](https://www.longmontyarn.com/)).  Highly recommend checking them out if you're around Longmont, Colorado.

You can find my knitting on my [ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/people/booksforever).  I have done work with lace, colorwork, beads, e-textiles, and more!

Check back here as there are some secret coding/knitting things in the works!
