## Beardatrice

Beardatrice is my bearded dragon that I got August 2020.  He does very well around other people, although he only tolerates pets.  He is good at cuddling, although he doesn't do it often.  His favorite foods are mealworms, dubia roaches, corn, and acorn squash.

## Zea

Zea is a corn snake that I got in 2023.  He is a baby corn snake.  We think he may be lavendar, although it's possible we will update tihs as he gets older.

## Maisie

Maisie is a corn snake that I also got in 2023.  She is a little older than Zea, but basically the same age.  She is a snow and has a lovely little yellow nose.

## St. George

St. George is a white-eyed crocodile skink.  He loves hiding and playing dead when handled.  He has started getting more confident and yells at me a lot when I do checkups on him.  His favorite food is mealworms.

## Entwives

The entwives are what I call my group of mourning geckos.  Since mourning geckos are parthenogenic, I generally have some babies and/or eggs around.  I do name the babies when they come out with tree names, however, since they are all clones, I cannot tell them apart after that.
