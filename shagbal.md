# Shaggerday

Saturday, January 3rd, Dragon House

We will have a shag lesson 12-1pm.  This will be an introductory lesson to get you going!  

Open dancing from 1-3pm or as long as people are around 

Feel free to come to whatever part of it makes sense to you!


# Balboa Brunch

Sunday, January 4th, Bloom House

Our lovely afternoon practice returns in the new year! Join us from 12pm - around 3pm (or later) to practice your balboa!  No formal lesson, but folks are generally happy to work on things!

Folks will often bring food to share, details and theme to be announced. This too is informal, and please don't feel obligated, bring food if it makes you happy, eat food if it makes you happy, dance if it makes you happy


# What to bring

* dance shoes (we want to keep people's dance floors nice and clean!)
* water bottle (although cups will be available at the homes if you forget)
* food (if it feels good and you want to share)


# What to expect
We work to create a warm and welcoming environment to practice dance! Expect to ask people to dance and to be asked to dance. Feel free to say no at any time and for any reason. 

Check out [Santa Fe Swing Code of Conduct](https://santafebalboa.org/code-of-conduct/) for more details on our scene's code of conduct and dance ettiquette.

This is a less formal environment than a dance hall, so it is more open to what you want out of it!  Generally, you can find people who just want to dance, people who want to work out some moves, people who will talk to you about dance theory (and lots of other theories), and people who would love to just hang out and watch and talk!

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me (Ryn) or any of the other folks with any questions!  (see contact info at top)
