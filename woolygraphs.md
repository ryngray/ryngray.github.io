# Wooly Graphs

Wooly graphs aims to model knitting through the world of graph theory! 


###Practical Layouts

In terms of practical layouts, we currently have methods for simple knitting. We are working on more complex knitting.

Read our paper here: [A Graph Model and a Layout Algorithm for Knitting Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13800)



###Theoretical Knitting Graphs

On the theoretical knitting side, we have also focused on simple knitting.  However, we also have some theorems and proofs for general knitting.
